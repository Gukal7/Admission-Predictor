# Admission-Predictor
A predictor made using machine learning algorithm that predicts the chance of admission for Masters in USA of a student based on some parameters.

In this project, there are many exam points taken in various exam systems. A variety of analyzes will be obtained from these exams. We will use python programming language. Our system will consist of three stages. The first stage data will be preprocessed. However, there are various analyzes and graphs. In the next step, I have used linear regression machine learning algorithm on a certain dataset and predicted the accuracy score by training the model.
“Admission Predictor” would predict the chance of admission of a student based on the input values.
I built this project with the purpose of helping students in shortlisting universities with their profiles. The predicted output gives them a fair idea about their chances for admission in a particular university.

The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs. The parameters included are :
•	GRE Scores ( out of 340 )
•	TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )
•	University Rating ( out of 5 )
•	Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 )
•	Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 )
•	Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 )
•	Chance of Admit ( ranging from 0 to 1 )
